        <p class="lead">
            We need a system that will help us to automate and track our works.
            We are an NGO who works for feeding deprived people and children.
            We have observed that people are wasting a ton of food every day
            in Dhaka city (like office programs, buffets, etc.). We are on a
            mission to make the usage of this food. We have contacted some
            restaurants, and they agreed to give us those foods before it gets
            rotten, or they will preserve those foods till we collect them.
            We have some employees and still enrolling.
